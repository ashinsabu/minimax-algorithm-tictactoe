# minimax-algorithm-tictactoe

A tic tac toe web app that implements the minimax algorithm for the AI to find the best possible next move by recursively assigning preference values to each board state by trying out different moves.

It implements a normal PVP mode as well as a P vs AI mode where the AI always plays the best possible move determined by the algorithm after reading all possible future states of the board on every possible move efficiently.
